# slackReact
I made it because I want to make simple integrations in slack for my team. So, I tried to make it more extensible possible.
It is not finished and I am thinking about some modifications.

### How to use?
There is a sample folder in the repo and there you will see some examples and how it works. You will need the slack's token and a group name(it's just working in channels, I'm working on it).

### Contribute
Feel free to contribuite(PR, issue, etc...), this is my first project, like this, related with PHP and I am not perfect and I never will be, so let's learn together. 
Anything else just contact me: [@zexias](https://twitter.com/zexias)
